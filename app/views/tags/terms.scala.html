    Registering as a ‘Game of Games’ user will give you access to secure content such as a virtual ‘passport to play’ and
    virtual ‘game of games’ cards. Once you register, these materials can be accessed on any web browser.

    Registering will also enroll you in a research study being conducted by investigators from The University of Iowa.
    The purpose of the study is to get a sense of how you think about playing and learning, to gather information about playtime in your household, and to gather information about how you use the ‘game of games’ materials.

    We are inviting you to be in this study because you are a parent or primary caregiver of a child or children.
    Approximately 2000 people will take part in this study.

    If you agree to participate, we will ask you a few questions about you and your family such as your age and the age
    of your children. From time to time as you use the ‘game of games’ web site, we will ask you survey questions to get
    a better sense of how you think about playing and learning. We will also track your usage of the secure ‘game of games’
    materials to help us design better materials in the future. You are free to skip any questions that you prefer not to
    answer. It will take approximately 1-5 minutes to answer questions each time we ask.

    We will keep the information you provide confidential, however federal regulatory agencies and the University of Iowa
    Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies) may inspect and copy records
    pertaining to this research.

    To register, you will select a username and password of your choice. Please select a username that does not include
    your first name, last name, or other identifying information. We will create an identification number that will be
    associated with your ‘game of games’ profile and the information we collect. This means that it will not be possible
    to link you to your responses or to the information we gather.

    There are no known risks from being in this study, and you will not benefit personally.  However we hope that others
    may benefit in the future from what we learn as a result of this study.

    Taking part in this research study is completely voluntary.
